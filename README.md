### Chest X-Ray Classification
This repository focuses on classifying chest X-ray images using deep learning models to detect diseases such as pneumonia. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately classify X-ray images based on patterns associated with different health conditions

### Features
- Dataset: Uses a medical image dataset for classification tasks (JSRT)
- Model: Implements CNNs for image classification
- Implementation: Built using PyTorch for model training and evaluation
