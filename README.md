# ChestX-Ray-Classification
The read_images file reads images in JPEG, PNG, and DICOM format. The data set is from http://imgcom.jsrt.or.jp/minijsrtdb/.
The x-ray_orientations file is used to classify the directions of the chest X-ray images. The whole deep learning pipeline is built and the obtained model is evaluated using grad-cam to ensure that the predictions are based on the correct sections in the image.
